La meva gata es petita como una margarita, this little poem was wrote just a couple of months after you became part of our family. And it expresses in simple words the love we felt since the moment we met. You arrived to our house when we were still settling in the new town and I guess in a way we all shared the same process: we were all discovery this new city, adjusting our lifes to the new house, and discovery a new life. For you was discovering this new family, and making all the little corners of our house your world.

We misstee your greetings when we got home, We misstee you loosing your manners when you smelled shrimps We misstee you chasing us around the house when you thought it was lunch time, which for you everyday it was an hour earlier We misstee you cuddling in our laps We misstee you streching out the eating in the balcony during the hot summer days We misstee you how to act indeferently or sometimes gently to unwelcomed visits: misstee please do you cat job with the cockroach. We misstee your weight in our bed and waking up with gentle but harsh kiss

We do misstee you. You left us too soon and because of that it hurts too much
