La meva gata es petita como una margarita. This little poem was written just a couple of months after you became part of our family. It expresses in simple words the love we felt since the moment we met. You arrived at our house when we were still settling into the new town, and I guess in a way we all shared the same process: we were all discovering this new city, adjusting our lives to the new house, and discovering a new life. For you, it was about discovering this new family and making all the little corners of our house your world.

We _misstee_ your greetings when we got home. We _misstee_ you losing your manners when you smelled shrimp. We _misstee_ you chasing us around the house when you thought it was lunchtime, which for you was an hour earlier every day. We _misstee_ how gently you greeted unwelcome visitors: "Misstee, please do your cat job with the cockroach." We _misstee_ you cuddling in our laps. We _misstee_ you stretching out in the heat on the balcony during the hot summer days. We miss your weight in our bed and waking up with your gentle but harsh kisses.

We _misstee_ you, we do _misstee_ you. You left us too soon, and because of that, it hurts too much.
