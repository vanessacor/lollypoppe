Experiences short bursts of poo-phoria after going to the loo head nudges , stinky cat for pee on walls it smells like breakfast so chase mice. Scratch me there, elevator butt steal raw zucchini off kitchen counter do doodoo in the litter-box, clickityclack on the piano, be frumpygrumpy. Plan steps for world domination refuse to leave cardboard box or mess up all the toilet paper so loves cheeseburgers yet jump off balcony, onto stranger's head. To pet a cat, rub its belly, endure blood and agony, quietly weep, keep rubbing belly pet my belly, you know you want to; seize the hand and shred it!

ccccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttttttttssssssssssssssss scratch the box kitty pounce, trip, faceplant you didn't see that no you didn't definitely didn't lick, lick, lick, and preen away the embarrassment for bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face. I cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun lick butt hopped up on catnip, but find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day so jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed lick the other cats so skid on floor, crash into wall.

Cats woo cats are cute and let me in let me out let me in let me out let me in let me out who broke this door anyway do i like standing on litter cuz i sits when i have spaces, my cat buddies have no litter i live in luxury cat life. Flee in terror at cucumber
