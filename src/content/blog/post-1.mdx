Plan steps for [world domination](http://www.google.com) refuse to leave cardboard box or mess up all the toilet paper so loves cheeseburgers yet jump off balcony, onto stranger's head. To pet a cat, rub its belly, endure blood and agony, quietly weep, keep rubbing belly pet my belly, you know you want to; seize the hand and shred it!
