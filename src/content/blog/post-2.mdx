When I realised that I wanted to pursuit a career in web development, I create my website to showcase my work. This was built using react with the content written in Markdown. If you are curious check it out.

Now I been working as a software engineer for 2 years now and I wanted to redo or improve my website so it could: have a blog, redo some sections to reflect more my current place.

First I had to choose the structure: should I keep the same or start from scratch. I decided to keep the same structure and same design (for now). The reason for this was so I could get something up faster.

[insert here some sketch/wireframes]

Now that I decided about the structure was time to decided which stack should I build my new website with: should I continue with react? should I use Vue (same framework I use at work)? Should I try something different? React - React continues to be the number1 framework and probably I could use some refreshment and practice. Vue - part of daily work and if I go with it I could probably experiment and test different things that will help me at work. Despite having good reasons to choose either React or Vue, I decided to go with a different approach and use the new kid on the block: Astro.js First let me explain in a fewer words what Astro is: Astro is a open source [static site](/glossary#static-site) generator. What is a [Static Site Generator](/glossary#static-site-generator)?
