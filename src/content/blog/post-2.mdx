When I first discovered my passion for web development, I embarked on a journey to create my own website, a platform to showcase my portfolio. While learning Leveraging React, I built a clean and efficient React website, with content written in Markdown. If you're curious, feel free to check it out.

Fast forward two years, and now working as a software engineer, I felt the urge to revamp my website and incorporate a blog section. Additionally, I wanted to update certain sections to better reflect my current position and growth.

The initial question I faced was whether to retain the existing structure or start from scratch. Ultimately, I decided to go with the latter option. This meant I needed to choose the right stack for building my new website. Should I continue in the React realm? Considering my experience with Vue at work, should I move to the Vue world instead? Or should I try something different?

It is all about learning new things, so I decide to use totally new tool: no React or Vue for that matter.

Keeping in mind that my previous website was a static site generated from Markdown files, with no back-end or hard-coded HTML content, I wanted to maintain this approach. Hence, my choice had to fall within the JamStack realm.

After careful consideration, I decided to embrace the new kid on the block: Astro.js. For those unfamiliar, Astro is an open-source framework that allows developers to build websites where content is generated from Markdown files. It aligns perfectly with my desired approach while offering exciting new possibilities.

For those unfamiliar, let me briefly explain what Astro.js is. Astro is an open-source framework that empowers developers to build websites where content is generated from Markdown files. It aligns perfectly with my desired approach, while offering exciting new possibilities.

With this fresh technology in my arsenal, I am excited to embark on this website revamp journey. I look forward to utilizing Astro.js to its fullest potential and crafting an exceptional online presence. Stay tuned for updates on my progress!
