I'm a software engineer at [Glovo](https://about.glovoapp.com/), a food delivery service. I've been working as a frontend engineer, developing advanced features for a large-scale web application tailored to Glovo partners, from inception until reaching a mature state, to serve a diverse user base monthly.

I've been refactoring of legacy code, introducing modular design patterns, improving test coverage, and shipping features to the most recent version of `Vue.js`.

As a team member, I collaborate closely with backend developers, UX/UI designers, and product managers to align on project requirements and deliverables.

Additionally, I lead initiatives that involve writing and updating documentation for features, APIs, and workflows to ensure clarity and knowledge sharing within the team.
