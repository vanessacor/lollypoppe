I'm a software engineer at [Glovo](https://about.glovoapp.com/), a food delivery service. I've been working as a frontend engineer, developing advanced features for a large-scale web application tailored to Glovo partners, from inception until reaching a mature state, to serve a diverse user base of X monthly.

I've been helping refactoring of legacy code, introducing modular design patterns, improving test coverage, and shipping features to the most recent version of Vue.js. As a team member I also provide value by gathering requirements, planning, and managing implementation of new features.
