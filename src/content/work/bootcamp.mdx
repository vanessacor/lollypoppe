I started learning autonomously web developing at the begining of 2019, building some projects along the way. I then had the opportunity to do a 6 months FullStack Bootcamp at [Factoria F5](https://factoriaf5.org/). Here I expanded my frontend skills and acquired new backend skills by building some projects using the popular PHP framework: [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). I also had the privilege to be trained in agile methodologies.

During these years, I played with several projects, both collaborative and personal. These experiences included: my personal static website, an institutional website with a custom content management system, a couple of small web applications, like appointment and bookshelf management.

By using a range of technologies such as PHP, Javascript, MySQL, React, Node.js, and more, these projects have not only expanded my technical capabilities but also provided me a valuable experience in team collaboration and project management.
