      Hey there! Welcome to my website. I'm a front-end developer by trade, but
      life has taken me on quite the journey. In a past life, I found myself
      immersed in the fields of psychology, social services, and education where
      I worked as a psychologist and a support worker. Talk about diverse
      experiences!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here in my personal ðŸŒ± digital garden, I have the freedom to express
      myself and share my thoughts. It's important to note that everything I
      write here is purely my own opinion and doesn't reflect the views of the
      company I currently work for. It's a place where I can consolidate my
      understanding of all things technical through my content.
    </p>
    <p>
      But don't think it's all serious coding and programming talk! I believe in
      finding joy in the little things, so you'll also find me writing about the
      things that bring a smile to my face. From the thrill of skateboarding and
      surfing to the soul-stirring power of music and books, and even maybe some
      explorations on food and places. Ocassionally you might also find some
      introspections notes about life, work and the world around me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a mix of the technical and the personal, because life is all about
      balance, right?
