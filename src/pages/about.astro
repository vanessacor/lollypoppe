    <p>If you want to know more my career, you can find it here</p>
    <p>
      My name is Vanessa and this is my digital garden, where I share my
      thoughts, learnings and my pet projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I have the freedom to express myself- It's important to note that
      everything I write here is purely my own opinion and doesn't reflect the
      views of the company I currently work for. This is a place where I can
      consolidate my understanding of all learnings, and also where I share some
      reflections on my experiences as a web developer.
    </p>
    <p>But don't think it's all serious coding and programming talk!</p>
    <p>
      I believe in finding joy in the little things, so you'll also find me
      writing about the things that bring a smile to my face. From the sports I
      love - skateboarding, surfing, tennis - to music, books,food and places.
      Ocassionally you might also find some introspections notes about life,
      work and the world around me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a mix of the technical and the personal, because life is all about
      balance, right?
